While there are many companies out there that have fully returned all their employees back to the office for fully in-person work, there will always be a market of employee and employees that will prefer to reach a working agreement that is location agnostic. This might not be possible to achieve for all companies across all industries, but I firmly believe that remote work is ultimately better than in-person work for most companies that mainly perform business over the internet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Our Services</title><link>https://yordan.llc/services/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2024 15:35:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yordan.llc/services/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fernando Yordan LLC offers a comprehensive suite of services designed to empower businesses through expert software development and strategic technology consulting.
