I don&amp;rsquo;t deny that there is value to routine and in-person work, but there&amp;rsquo;s more value in working for the life we want than there is in living for the work we have. A life with the freedom to choose where and how we work is better than a life that shaped by our work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Services</title><link>https://yordan.llc/services/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2024 15:35:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yordan.llc/services/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="open-to-contract-or-full-time-roles">Open to Contract or Full-Time Roles&lt;/h2>
