I enjoy solving problems and am well versed with modern technologies in the field of AI, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Systems Engineering, DevOps, and Data Engineering, as well as building high performing technology teams with Generative Cultures in Agile environments. With experience as both an IC in companies like Google and Amazon, as well as a CTO in a Technology Startup, I understand how to scale bootstrap solutions to fully capable commercial products and teams.

The following truths have shaped me into who I am today:
  - I enjoy mathematics, engineering, and problem solving at a deep level, likely coming from competing in math and robotics competitions from high school.
  - I graduated with a master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT
  - I have worked in large tech companies like Google and Amazon as a software engineer
  - I have worked at 3 different startups, acting as CTO in one of them.
  - I moved to Puerto Rico to work remotely near my family during the Covid pandemic and don't expect that to change any time soon.
