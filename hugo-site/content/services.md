## Open to Contract or Full-Time Roles
Do you want me to be part of your team ? I cannot guarantee my availability for full-time work but I am open to network for future opportunities or part-time remote work.
Schedule an Interview with me.
Hands On Project Work
Schedule a free consultation with me to go over the problem that you need solving. I will discuss with you potential solutions, and if applicable a free discovery call to understand the challenges that we may face together.

## Hands On Project Work
I will provide a value based priced proposal for the final deliverable custom fit to your specific needs.
Ideal for those that need a short term project done but do not have the budget for staffing a temporary development team.

## Ad Hoc Consulting and Training
I can provide one free 1 hour consultation to understand the problems that you are facing and suggest actionable next steps to make progress towards your goals. These consultations are typically focused on identifying bottlenecks, skill and knowledge gaps, or opportunities for your team.
Follow up training, workshops or consultation priced at $250 an hour.
