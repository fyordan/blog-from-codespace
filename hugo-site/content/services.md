Fernando Yordan LLC offers a comprehensive suite of services designed to empower businesses through expert software development and strategic technology consulting. Our offerings are tailored to meet diverse client needs, from hands-on project execution to high-level strategic guidance.

## Contract and Full-Time Engagements

While our primary focus is on project-based and consulting engagements, we are open to exploring select contract or full-time opportunities that align with our expertise and availability. We welcome networking inquiries for future collaborations or part-time remote positions.

## Hands-On Project Development

We provide end-to-end software development services, transforming your concepts into robust, high-quality solutions. We invite you to schedule a complimentary consultation to discuss your specific challenges and project requirements. This initial discussion may be followed by a free discovery call to thoroughly understand the intricacies and potential obstacles of your project.

Our proposals are value-based, meticulously crafted to align with your unique needs and deliver tangible results. This service is ideal for organizations seeking to complete specific projects without the overhead of staffing a temporary development team.

## Strategic Consulting and Training

We offer strategic consulting to help identify critical bottlenecks, address skill and knowledge gaps, and uncover new opportunities within your technology landscape. Your first one-hour consultation is complimentary, providing actionable insights and a clear roadmap towards achieving your objectives.

Subsequent training sessions, workshops, and ongoing consultations are available at a rate of $250 per hour, designed to provide continuous support and expertise to your team.
