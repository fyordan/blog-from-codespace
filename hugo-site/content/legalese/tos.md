**1. Acceptance of Terms**

By requesting or engaging in services provided by Fernando Yordan LLC ("we," "us," or "our"), you ("the Client") hereby agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this document. Fernando Yordan LLC offers professional services encompassing software consultancy and development.

**2. Scope of Work and Project Commencement**

The scope of work for each client and project may vary. Accordingly, the Client agrees to thoroughly review all documentation detailing the scope of work, associated costs, and project timelines before the commencement of any services. Fernando Yordan LLC will not seek compensation for consultations, quotes, discovery sessions, or interviews explicitly designated as free. Billable work will only commence upon mutual agreement and signature of a formal engagement document.

**3. Billing and Payment**

Billing and payment terms will be mutually agreed upon by Fernando Yordan LLC and the Client prior to the initiation of any billable work. These terms may vary based on the specific client and project requirements.

**4. Project Estimates and Compensation**

Fernando Yordan LLC will not seek compensation for work performed outside the parameters of the agreed-upon scope. In the event that project work is anticipated to exceed a previously provided estimate, Fernando Yordan LLC will promptly inform the Client and seek explicit approval before continuing billable work. Fernando Yordan LLC reserves the right to offer discounts to clients or adjust rates for future projects, independent of any existing agreements.

**5. Quality Assurance and Risk Management**

Fernando Yordan LLC is committed to delivering high-quality deliverables and will exercise its best efforts to achieve this. We will proactively inform the Client of any perceived risks that may impact the project's success, acting in the Client's best interest. Should a deliverable, as specified in the contract, become unachievable, Fernando Yordan LLC will inform the Client and attempt to renegotiate the contract. If a mutual agreement cannot be reached, Fernando Yordan LLC will not seek payment for any uncompleted milestones, even if advance payments have been received.

**6. Subcontracting and Communication**

Fernando Yordan LLC will not outsource any work without the explicit approval of the Client. Generally, the Client will maintain direct communication with the developer or consultant performing the work.

**7. Client Responsibilities**

The Client agrees to act in good faith and provide all necessary information and cooperation required for the successful fulfillment of any agreed-upon contract.

**8. Conflict of Interest and Right to Refuse Service**

Fernando Yordan LLC will inform the Client of any potential conflicts of interest. We reserve the right to decline services to any prospective client if such service would jeopardize our obligations to other clients or if it conflicts with compliance requirements of any relevant authority.
