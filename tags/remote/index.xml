While there are many companies out there that have fully returned all their employees back to the office for fully in-person work, there will always be a market of employee and employees that will prefer to reach a working agreement that is location agnostic. This might not be possible to achieve for all companies across all industries, but I firmly believe that remote work is ultimately better than in-person work for most companies that mainly perform business over the internet.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
