I don&amp;rsquo;t deny that there is value to routine and in-person work, but there&amp;rsquo;s more value in working for the life we want than there is in living for the work we have. A life with the freedom to choose where and how we work is better than a life that shaped by our work.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
